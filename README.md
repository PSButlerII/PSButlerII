Greetings.  My name is Preston Butler and I am a new software developer.  I am currently attending TechElevator's November Cohort learning Java.  I have 2 year of real world experience with C#, and my objective is to build up my JavaScript knowledge, add Java to my OOP list, and then move on to becoming better at Python.  I love solving problems, and looking for solutions.  I'm good when collaborating, as I will try to remain objective to the facts of the input and expect output of the operation.  I will also pick up a language or a new technology if it is a requirement to complete a project or  it becomes a part of the solution.  Nothing is out of the realm of possibilities, as learning and understanding will always occur.  The brain is just awesome that way.
