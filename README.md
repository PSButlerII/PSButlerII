I am Preston Butler, a dedicated learner and a problem-solver at heart, currently enriching my skills at TechElevator's November Cohort with a focus on Java. With a robust foundation in C# backed by two years of real-world experience, my journey in the tech world is driven by a love for finding innovative solutions and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. My objective is to expand my expertise in JavaScript, strengthen my Java skills, and then delve deeper into Python, enhancing my versatility in object-oriented programming (OOP).

My journey in technology is complemented by a strong background in management and maintenance, where I've thrived in diverse roles, from grassroots positions to leadership. This unique blend of experiences has shaped me into a team player with an outgoing personality and a steadfast work ethic, qualities I bring to every project I undertake.

I am not just a coder; I am a collaborator who values objectivity and practicality in approaching challenges. My adaptability is evident in my willingness to embrace new technologies and languages as part of the solution. I firmly believe in the boundless potential of the mind to learn and understand, viewing every challenge as an opportunity for growth.

As I continue my academic journey in Computer Science, my goal is to emerge as a Full Stack Developer. Already familiar with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I am eager to apply my skills in a junior Software Engineer role. My track record of improving data processing times, enhancing functionalities, and troubleshooting complex code issues stands testament to my passion and capability in software development.

In summary, my journey is one of continuous learning, adaptability, and a relentless drive to contribute meaningfully to the tech world. I am excited about the opportunities to integrate my diverse skills and experiences into innovative technological solutions.
